\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reducing number of normative graphs to be considered \newline
Aggregation is summation: Loses some structural information. Difficult to reconstruct graph from representation. Alternatives? If we can do this, graph synthesis \newline
Missing pools. Use transductive methods. \newline
Can we achieve perfect information for link/node prediction without retaining the whole graph? \newline
