% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.

\begin{abstract}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To respond to an outage or determine the cause of failure, operators and/or developers of the system typically reason both about the presence or absence of events and their interactions in an anomalous execution when compared with the normal behavior of the system. Distributed traces capture causality of events occurring across system components and can therefore be used to troubleshoot outages, since anomalous executions must surely differ from steady state executions - in the events, their interactions, or other attributes such as CPU or memory usage. In order to find \textit{how} the trace from an anomalous execution diverges from steady state, it may be necessary to reason about the similarities and differences across many traces. Current tooling provides features to extract and summarize features for each individual traces, but provides little support for reasoning and analysis across traces. By contrast, analysis tools that allow efficient comparisons among traces use data representations, such as flattening graphs using a depth first walk, that lose valuable \textit{structural} information regarding causal relationships among the recorded events.

In this paper, we explore the construction and use of structural embeddings, borrowed from the NLP literature, to represent and compare traces in a way that preserves their causal context. We present quantitative results demonstrating that the learned embeddings outperform the state of the art for traces drawn from execution paths which correspond to functionality such as checking out an item, viewing the product page and listing item(s) to sell. We also present qualitative results demonstrating the application of our technique to provide hints for troubleshooting outages.
